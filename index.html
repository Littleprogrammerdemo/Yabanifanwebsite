        <h2 class="actress">Özge Aydın (Nur Fettahoğlu)</h2>
        <p  class="text">
            Özge is not a major actress, but her role adds layers of complexity to the relationships within the show. As Güven's wife, she is a seemingly sweet and gentle character, but her presence often leads to misunderstandings and tension, especially between Güven and Neslihan. Her character is designed to act as a quiet catalyst for conflict, creating subtle emotional challenges in the family. While she may appear as a supportive partner to Güven, her actions can have unintended consequences, especially when it comes to the existing dynamics with other characters.

Although her storyline is less defined, her presence is felt, especially when she provides emotional or practical assistance to the family members. Feride seems to be someone who holds a quieter but meaningful role, offering support during difficult times. Her actions and motivations may become clearer as the series progresses, but for now, she serves as a stabilizing figure in the background. Despite the mystery surrounding her role, she adds a layer of depth to the family dynamics. Her loyalty and support make her a valued ally to the Soysalan family.

        <p  class="text">
            Osman is Eşref's most trusted man, loyal and reliable in his role. While he doesn't have a significant amount of screen time, his presence is quietly influential. He is a character who doesn't seek the spotlight but instead prefers to operate in the background, ensuring that things run smoothly. Osman’s loyalty to Eşref gives him an essential role in the family’s inner circle, providing a sense of security. His reliability makes him a solid foundation for the family, even if he isn’t involved in major plotlines. Though not an overtly prominent figure, Osman leaves a good impression through his dependability and understated wisdom.

            <h2 class="actor">Deniz Aydın (Ata Artman)</h2>
            <p  class="text">
                Deniz Aydın, portrayed by Ata Artman, is a complex and intriguing character in the series. Initially introduced as a charming and seemingly friendly individual, he quickly reveals a darker, more unpredictable side. His psychological complexity makes him an unpredictable figure, as he often operates in morally gray areas. Though his motivations remain unclear for much of his screen time, Deniz's interactions with other characters suggest a potential for manipulation and conflict, making him a character to watch closely.
            </p>
            <img class="image" src="deniz.jpg" alt="" height="500" width="500">
            <h2 class="actress">Leyla / Elif  (Gizem Sevim)</h2>
            <p  class="text">
                Leyla, also known as Elif, is a strong, confident woman who is never afraid to speak her mind. With her striking beauty, bold personality, and fierce passion, she commands attention wherever she goes.

            <h2 class="actor">Tolga (Sarp Ilker)</h2>
        <p  class="text">
            Tolga is the charming and warm-hearted character who provides a refreshing contrast to the more intense personalities in the show. His kind and genuine nature makes him likable, though his romantic interest in Asi seems unlikely to materialize due to their stark differences.         </p>
            <img class="image" src="Sarp.jpg" alt=""height="500" width="500">
            <h2 class="actor">Zafer Demirhan (Kaan Çakır)</h2>
            <p  class="text">
                Zafer is the quintessential villain that viewers hate. His actions stir up much of the drama and conflict in the series, making him one of the most disliked characters. However, Kaan Çakır’s portrayal of Zafer adds layers of complexity, ensuring the character isn't just a one-dimensional antagonist. His villainous nature is pivotal to driving the storyline forward, and while his actions generate tension, they also highlight his compelling, multifaceted role in the series.            </p>
                <img class="image" src="Zafer.jpg" alt=""height="500" width="500">
                <h2 class="actress">Melek (Hayrunnisa Uzun)</h2>
                <p  class="text">
                    Melek is the epitome of sweetness and innocence, a young girl whose quiet and reserved nature contrasts sharply with the more forceful, dramatic personalities around her. At first glance, she may seem like a background figure, but her subtle presence lingers long after each scene. There’s a gentle charm in her silence, and her vulnerability captivates viewers, drawing them into her world. Melek's mysterious quietness is not just a passive trait; it suggests a deeper emotional complexity, hinting at a hidden past and unresolved experiences that make her more than just a passive observer of the events unfolding around her.

                    The enigma of her silence gives her an almost ethereal quality, provoking curiosity about the reasons behind her subdued demeanor. Is it the result of a trauma, a deep sorrow, or an intense internal conflict that keeps her from speaking? Her inner world is shrouded in mystery, and viewers are left to wonder what lies beneath her calm exterior. Melek’s purity—both in her actions and her spirit—brings a rare softness to the otherwise turbulent atmosphere of the series. In the midst of the chaos, she offers a moment of serenity, as if she's untouched by the drama surrounding her.
                    
                    Her quietness isn’t a weakness, but rather a strength, as she navigates through the story without drawing attention to herself. Her gentleness becomes her power, and over time, it's clear that there’s more to Melek than meets the eye. Her role may start out as small, but as the narrative progresses, more of her past, her motivations, and the complexity of her character are likely to be revealed, gradually turning her into a pivotal figure whose impact is felt more deeply with each passing episode.

                    Şebnem’s brother and Rüya’s uncle, Selim is connected to key family dynamics in the series, but his role remains secondary. His interactions often revolve around supporting the core characters and offering a sense of familiarity.                </p>

                        Elmas is the mother of Asi in the series. As the mother of such a central character, Elmas plays a crucial role in shaping Asi's character and worldview. Their relationship is one that is rich in emotional depth, with Elmas providing guidance, support, and sometimes conflict to her daughter.
